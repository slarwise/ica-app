# ICA API - Recipes, shopping lists etc

The unofficial API is documented
[here](https://github.com/svendahlstrand/ica-api), it hasn't been updated in a
long time though.

## Features

- Add items to shopping list. I want to be able to have pre-configured recipes
  that can be added with one click. It's possible to do this with ICA's own
  recipes.
